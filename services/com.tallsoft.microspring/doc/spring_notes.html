<h2>Spring Framework IOC notes</h2>
<p>Before starting on MicroSpring it was important to gather notes on 'best practice' 
  and 'minimum practice' for IOC in Spring. These notes are below, often directly 
  cut and pasted from the Spring 1.1.3 help text. This works as a small guide 
  on using the Spring Framework. It also formed the ground work for the Micro 
  Spring implementation.</p>
<p>Do not bother reading it, unless you are really bored. Instead look at the 
  one page crib sheet.</p>
<h2>Spring Crib Sheet Author: J.Gibbons 13/2/05<br>
  (for the average user, on green field project)</h2>
<p>All taken from the spring documentation at:<br>

<h2>Example</h2>

<h2>My Attitude, and how to choose the bits I want</h2>
<p>IOC is OK, kinda works, but does create stupid chinese walls in your code. 
  But, why not. Given that attitude, why not use spring as its this years fasion 
  in Java Land (much like Jboss was 2 or 3 years ago). However, only a cut down, 
  simple spring, and not the entire &#8220;run time, heavy framework, retrain 
  all your staff&#8221;, environment. </p>
<p>Or to put it another way, what I want from spring is IOC. If I want something 
  for ORM or AOP or resource bundles or event propogation I will use something 
  else small and light. I do not believe in making XML config files contain complex 
  logic and config which is better placed in a database or java code.</p>
<p>Transaction management &#8211; loads of java gurus recon that it is terribly 
  hard and your average developer is an idiot so their framework will do it all 
  for you through an xml(read deployment ascii) file. I disagree. When I write 
  code and look at code I want the behaviour to be within the code, and to be 
  explicit. So again, I discard springs transactional AOPtastic, embedded meta 
  data approach. Likewise their jdbc implementation &#8211; it may have some good 
  stuff in, but it is not the standard, and requires training. Database access 
  is not hard, there is no need to protect folks from it.</p>
<p>Web frameworks. I don&#8217;t believe in springs new kid on the block/encapsulate 
  the world mantra. Web apps are no longer nearly as important as they were &#8211; 
  Fit Clients are back. Lots of choices are out there, so choose one &#8211; JSF 
  or Struts seem good and are still modern.</p>
<p>In summary, spring encourages you to pick and choose from its services, and 
  I have. IOC and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<h2>Hints and tips &#8211; very short version:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid anything that ties your code to the spring framework.</li>
  <li> Do use ApplicationListener to get refresh and close events for your singletons 
    on close down (even though it is a spring interface).</li>
  <li> Use setters and not constructors for injection.</li>
  <li> For most users, beans in the container will be singletons.</li>
  <li> If the bean is in the same xml config then use &lt;idref local=&quot;theTargetBean&quot;/&gt;</li>
  <li> Use &lt;idref&gt;theBeanId&lt;/idref&gt; to refer to other beans, and not 
    &lt;value&gt;theBeanId&lt;/value&gt;.</li>
  <li> To force order of creation you can use the depends-on=&#8221;beanId&#8221; 
  </li>
  <li>If you need lifecycle then use the init-method and destroy-method attributes. 
    Do not do this on singleton beans. &lt;bean id=&quot;egBean&quot; class=&quot;foo&quot; 
    init-method=&quot;init&quot; destroy-method=&quot;cleanup&quot;/&gt;</li>
  <li> Template beans avoid repitition; the abstract and parent attributes.</li>
  <li> Use ApplicationContext as your bean factory</li>
  <li> Do not use spring ApplicationListeners for broadcast of your own events 
    &#8211; write your own mechanism and avoid being tied to spring. Event frameworks 
    are very simple!</li>
  <li> ApplicationContextAware interface has method setApplicationContext() which 
    the app context calls, allows the use of app contexts (resources, events etc) 
    &#8211; but it ties you to spring!</li>
  <li> Data source beans are great, select your db pool implementation, define 
    a datasource bean or set of them and inject it in.</li>
  <li> changing the auto wiring mode is discouraged. i.e. the default works out 
    dependencies, and creation ordering.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your code</h2>
<pre>   InputStream is = new FileInputStream(&quot;beans.xml&quot;);
   XmlBeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory(is);</pre>
<h3>Factory methods:</h3>
<pre>   boolean containsBean(String)
   Object getBean(String) throws BeansException;
   Object getBean(String,Class) throws BeansException;
   boolean isSingleton(String) throws NoSuchBeanDefinitionException
   Class getType(String name) throws NoSuchBeanDefinitionException; 
   String[] getAliases(String) throws NoSuchBeanDefinitionException;</pre>
<h2>Java Beans, default Constructor</h2>
<p>Most people using Spring prefer to have actual JavaBeans (having just a default 
  (no-argument) constructor and appropriate setters and getters modelled after 
  the properties) in the BeanFactory</p>
<p>setter-based dependency injection is realized by calling setters on your beans 
  after invoking a no-argument constructor or no-argument static factory method 
  to instantiate your bean. Beans defined in the BeanFactory that use setter-based 
  dependency injection are true JavaBeans.</p>
<p>most users of Spring will not be dealing with these classes directly (i.e. 
  programmatically), but rather with an XML definition file which will be converted 
  internally into instances of these classes, and used to load an entire BeanFactory 
  or ApplicationContext.</p>
<h2>Complex types</h2>
<p>Null param value null = &lt;property name=&quot;email&quot;&gt;&lt;null/&gt;&lt;/property&gt;<br>
  Empty string value &#8220;&#8221; = &lt;property name=&quot;email&quot;&gt;&lt;/property&gt;</p>
<p>The list, set, map, and props elements allow properties and arguments of Java 
  type List, Set, Map, and Properties, respectively, to be defined and set.<br>
</p>
<pre>&lt;property name=&quot;people&quot;&gt;
   &lt;props&gt;
	   &lt;prop key=&quot;HarryPotter&quot;&gt;The magic property&lt;/prop&gt;
	   &lt;prop key=&quot;JerrySeinfeld&quot;&gt;The funny property&lt;/prop&gt;
   &lt;/props&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;!-- results in a setSomeList(java.util.List) call --&gt;
&lt;property name=&quot;someList&quot;&gt;
   &lt;list&gt;
  		&lt;value&gt;a list element followed by a reference&lt;/value&gt;
   	&lt;ref bean=&quot;myDataSource&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/list&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;!-- results in a setSomeMap(java.util.Map) call --&gt;
&lt;property name=&quot;someMap&quot;&gt;
   &lt;map&gt;
	   	&lt;entry key=&quot;yup an entry&quot;&gt;
		   	&lt;value&gt;just some string&lt;/value&gt;
	   	&lt;/entry&gt;
   	&lt;entry key=&quot;yup a ref&quot;&gt;
  		 	&lt;ref bean=&quot;myDataSource&quot;/&gt;
   	&lt;/entry&gt;
   &lt;/map&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;!-- results in a setSomeSet(java.util.Set) call --&gt;
&lt;property name=&quot;someSet&quot;&gt;
   &lt;set&gt;
	   &lt;value&gt;just some string&lt;/value&gt;
	   &lt;ref bean=&quot;myDataSource&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/set&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;</pre>
<p><br>
  Note that the value of a Map entry, or a set value, can also again be any of 
  the elements:<br>
  (bean | ref | idref | list | set | map | props | value | null)</p>
<h2><br>
  Ids or names in the config file</h2>
<p>Every bean has one or more ids (also called identifiers, or names; these terms 
  refer to the same thing). These ids must be unique within the BeanFactory or 
  ApplicationContext the bean is hosted in.</p>
<p>&#8230;you use the id or name attributes to specify the bean id(s), and at 
  least one id must be specified in one or both of these attributes. The id attribute 
  allows you to specify one id, and as it is marked in the XML DTD (definition 
  document) as a real XML element ID attribute, the parser is able to do some 
  extra validation when other elements point back to this one. As such, it is 
  the preferred way to specify a bean id.</p>
<p>An idref element is simply a shorthand and error-proof way to set a property 
  to the String id or name of another bean in the container.<br>
  Using the idref tag will allow Spring to validate at deployment time that the 
  other bean actually exists.<br>
  Additionally, if the bean being referred to is in the same actual XML file, 
  and the bean name is the bean id, the local attribute may be used, which will 
  allow the XML parser itself to validate the bean name even earlier, at XML document 
  parse time.<br>
  &lt;property name=&quot;targetName&quot;&gt;&lt;idref local=&quot;theTargetBean&quot;/&gt;&lt;/property&gt;</p>
<h2><br>
  Singleton or non singleton Attribute singleton=&quot;false&quot;</h2>
<p>For most users, the majority of the beans in the container will be singletons.</p>
<p>Beans are defined to be deployed in one of two modes: singleton or non-singleton.</p>
<p>...This potentially delayed visibility of some configuration issues is why 
  ApplicationContext by default pre-instantiates singleton beans. At the cost 
  of some upfront time and memory to create these beans before they are actually 
  needed, you find out about configuration issues when the ApplicationContext 
  is created, not later. If you wish, you can still override this default behavior 
  and set any of these singleton beans to lazy-load (not be pre-instantiated).</p>
<p>The non-singleton, prototype mode of a bean deployment results in the creation 
  of a new bean instance every time a request for that specific bean is done. 
  This is ideal for situations where for example each user needs an independent 
  user object or something similar.</p>
<p>Beans are deployed in singleton mode by default, unless you specify otherwise. 
  Keep in mind that by changing the type to non-singleton (prototype), each request 
  for a bean will result in a newly created bean and this might not be what you 
  actually want. So only change the mode to prototype when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Note: when deploying a bean in the prototype mode, the lifecycle of the bean 
  changes slightly. By definition, Spring cannot manage the complete lifecycle 
  of a non-singleton/prototype bean, since after it is created, it is given to 
  the client and the container does not keep track of it at all any longer.</p>
<p>Dependencies<br>
  1.The BeanFactory is created and initialized with a configuration which describes 
  all the beans.<br>
  2. Each bean has dependencies expressed in the form of properties, &#8230;. 
  These dependencies will be provided to the bean, when the bean is actually created.<br>
  3. Each property or constructor-arg is either an actual definition of the value 
  to set, or a reference to another bean in the BeanFactory.<br>
  4. Each property or constructor argument which is a value must be able to be 
  converted from whatever format it was specified in, to the actual type of that 
  property or constructor argument. (compex description in main docn, describes 
  all the lovely varients).<br>
  5. Bean configs are validated by spring, but only instatiated at creation time.<br>
  6. Spring will resolve dependancies (create beans) as late as possible. Can 
  lead to runtime exceptions if your beans are bad.</p>
<p>To make sure that there is a certain order of creation you can use the depends-on 
  attribute. <br>
  &lt;bean id=&quot;beanOne&quot; class=&quot;ExampleBean&quot; depends-on=&quot;manager&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;property name=&quot;manager&quot;&gt;&lt;ref local=&quot;manager&quot;/&gt;&lt;/property&gt;<br>
  &lt;/bean&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;bean id=&quot;manager&quot; class=&quot;ManagerBean&quot;/&gt;</p>
<h2><br>
  Abstract and child beans - a form of templating</h2>
<p>Notes: beans with no class defn are parent beans by default, the abstract keywork 
  means you are also specifying the base class impl. i.e. if no class name then 
  not a problem, spring just treats the beans as a template.</p>
<p>A bean definition potentially contains a large amount of configuration information, 
  including container specific information (i.e. initialization method, static 
  factory method name, etc.) and constructor arguments and property values. A 
  child bean definition is a bean definition which inherits configuration data 
  from a parent definition. It is then able to override some values, or add others, 
  as needed. Using parent and child bean definitions can potentially save a lot 
  of typing.<br>
  &lt;bean id=&quot;inheritedTestBean&quot; abstract=&quot;true&quot;<br>
  class=&quot;org.springframework.beans.TestBean&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;property name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;&lt;value&gt;parent&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/property&gt;<br>
  &lt;property name=&quot;age&quot;&gt;&lt;value&gt;1&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/property&gt;<br>
  &lt;/bean&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;bean id=&quot;inheritsWithDifferentClass&quot; class=&quot;org.springframework.beans.DerivedTestBean&quot;<br>
  parent=&quot;inheritedTestBean&quot; init-method=&quot;initialize&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;property name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;&lt;value&gt;override&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/property&gt;<br>
  &lt;!-- age should inherit value of 1 from parent --&gt;<br>
  &lt;/bean&gt;<br>
  A child bean definition will use the bean class from the parent definition if 
  none is specified, but can also override it. In the latter case, the child bean 
  class must be compatible with the parent, i.e. it must accept the parent's property 
  values.</p>
<p>Important Note: Application contexts (but not simple bean factories) will by 
  default pre-instantiate all singletons. Therefore it is important (at least 
  for singleton beans) that if you have a (parent) bean definition which you intend 
  to use only as a template, and this definition specifies a class, you must make 
  sure to set the abstract attribute to true, otherwise the application context 
  will actually pre-instantiate it.</p>
<h2>Application Context Events</h2>
<p>Provided through the ApplicationEvent class and ApplicationListener interface. 
  When deployed to an application context the bean will be notified of events 
  - the standard Observer design pattern. Spring provides three standard events: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ContextRefreshedEvent &#8211; event generated on start up.</li>
  <li>ContextClosedEvent &#8211; event when application context is closed</li>
  <li>RequestHandledEvent &#8211; for web events, spring specific.</li>
  <li>Custom Events - Simply call the publishEvent() method on the ApplicationContext, 
    specifying a parameter which is an instance of your custom event class implementing 
    ApplicationEvent. BUT DO NOT USE THEM &#8211; ties you to spring. And event 
    broadcasting is way too simple to do yourself, so why tie yourself to spring.</li>
</ul>
