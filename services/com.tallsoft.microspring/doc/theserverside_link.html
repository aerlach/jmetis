  Server Side have kindly linked to MicroSpring. Here I try to explain very briefly 
  the reasoning that led to MicroSpring.</p>
<p>First, a bow to the <a href="http://www.springframework.org/" target="spring">Spring 
  Framework</a> team, who have produced a great framework, and if you need a total 
  solution it's where you should go. However, my perspective is that I need a 
  smaller implementation and do not need many of it's features. Also an IOC framework 
  should be simple to learn, a page or two of documentation at most. </p>
<p>I have not yet talked to the Spring team, I am not endorsed by the Spring Framework, 
  and I am not competing in some rabid open source slanging match. I just want 
  a smaller code base, and no 3rd party library dependencies. Now, on to the kernel 
  of the matter.</p>
<h3>My Requirements</h3>
<p>To replace existing in-house, context based xml configurations with an IOC, 
  test friendly framework. The solution to be used on many small to medium sized 
  projects. Modules/sub-system running within the framework to be micro-bootable.</p>
<h3>The Assertion</h3>
<p>IOC is not hard, the Spring Framework has become the prominant implementation. 
  However, the Spring Framework does far more than IOC, and is now the size of 
  an alternative J2EE, with hooks to many other currently popular open source 
  technologies. It is micro-bootable through the refresh functions on the ApplicationContexts 
  (bean factories) - but I really need direct control of this.</p>
<p>Also, JDK1.5 is powerful, cohesive, comprehensive, supported, free, and you 
  don't risk pulling in terror-ware from the net. So an IOC framework based upon 
  this should need nothing else.</p>
<h3>The Proposal</h3>
<p>To strip away all the non IOC parts of Spring. Not only that, but to remove 
  all the customisations of IOC within Spring, to leave a single small implementation. 
  One with few lines of code, and zero dependencies on other open source. To embrace 
  JDK1.5 in terms of new core libs and the new language features.</p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>To write a new IOC container. One which is compatible with Spring, but a vastly 
  smaller framework. Focused purely on IOC, with no integration with, or dependency 
  on other open source projects. The reference implementation to be 'hacked out' 
  over a weekend due to time constraints.</p>
<h3>The result</h3>
<p>MicroSpring! And it's done, and tested, and released! Spring IOC without Spring. 
  But also, a challenge to others to produce an even smaller and leaner implementation 
  of IOC, which is ideally Spring compatible. This should be possible given more 
  time, and if I find more, I may make MicroSpring smaller, leaner, and, err, 
  meaner?</p>
<p>So, if you want to play with IOC, remain compatible with Spring, and thats 
  all, read on, and play with <a href="index.html">MicroSpring</a>.</p>
