This release bundle holds:

lib/microspring.jar	All you need to use micro spring.
src/*.*			The source code
src_test/*.*	The test code.  Run it in eclipse.
docs/			A version of the microspring web site.


You may pull the code apart, change the classpath, or anything else that makes it useful to your project/learning exercise.

If you think your changes are valid and within the concept of MicroSpring then stick it on the web somewhere and email me with the link and information.

All the best,
Jonathan
