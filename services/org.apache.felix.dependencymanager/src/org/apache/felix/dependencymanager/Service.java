     * required dependencies are resolved (effectively giving you a lazy
     * instantiation mechanism).
     * 
     * There are four special methods that are called when found through
     * reflection to give you some life-cycle management options:
     * <ol>
     * <li><code>init()</code> is invoked right after the instance has been
     * created, and before any dependencies are resolved, and can be used to
     * initialize the internal state of the instance</li>
     * <li><code>start()</code> is invoked after the required dependencies
     * are resolved and injected, and before the service is registered</li>
     * <li><code>stop()</code> is invoked right after the service is
     * unregistered</li>
     * <li><code>destroy()</code> is invoked after all dependencies are
     * removed</li>
     * </ol>
     * In short, this allows you to initialize your instance before it is
     * registered, perform some post-initialization and pre-destruction code
     * as well as final cleanup. If a method is not defined, it simply is not
     * called, so you can decide which one(s) you need. If you need even more
     * fine-grained control, you can register as a service state listener too.
